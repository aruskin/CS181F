Component 2 Review Report

Attendees: Skyler Lipscomb, Robin Momii, Amy Ruskin, Siyao Xie

Specifications:

Minor linguistic clarification: The specification states  "Component 1 initially sends a 
node of the search tree." Component 1 should be passing the value of a node, not a 
literal node, and the use of the phrase "search tree" might imply that we're using a 
binary search tree type rather than a binary tree. 
Characterization: QUESTION
SHOULD-FIX


Design:

KeyTriple vs NodeValue: Component 1 and Component 2 use inconsistent naming 
schemes for the type that is used as the value of the nodes of the binary tree. In the 
meeting, we decided on KeyTriple as the official name.
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST-FIX

Clean-up: Clarification that windows will be closed after use so that they're not still 
running in the background.
Characterization:  QUESTION
SHOULD-FIX

Methods actionPerformed vs clicked: The differences between and specific roles of 
the two methods are currently ambiguous.
Characterization: QUESTION
SHOULD-FIX

Displaying pictures: Inconsistencies between the specification (which mentions 
displaying pictures) and the design (which does not). Author should decide whether 
displaying pictures is feasible in this version and change the documentation 
accordingly. 
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST-FIX

Error-handling cases: The test plan refers to error handling practices that are not 
mentioned in either the design or specification.
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST-FIX

Instance variables: We were unsure whether button and display objects should be 
declared as instance variables.  If it turns out that they should be, author may want 
to add them to design.
Characterization: QUESTION
COMMENT


Test Plan: 

Usability testing: Test plan currently mentions "easy to read" as a requirement. 
There is not an automated way of measuring this, so may want to remove from test 
plan.
Characterization: QUESTION
SHOULD-FIX

Max characters: We discussed the cases in which Component 2 is passed strings that 
are too long to display, but were unsure how to resolve this issue.
Characterization: QUESTION
COMMENT

Error-handling correctness: We discussed whether or not the component's current 
expected approaches to handling errors were ideal. More detailed rationale of why 
the component's way of handling errors is correct may be useful.
Characterization: QUESTION

Conclusion:

Ultimately, most of the issues that were found were either ambiguous language or 
inconsistencies between documents. The fixes should thus consist of only a few 
clarifications and minor changes in terminology. Therefore, the component was 
approved with changes.
