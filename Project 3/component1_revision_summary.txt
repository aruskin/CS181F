Summary of changes to Component 1:

Specification:
* Added justification for adding plant names to characteristics list, as this was a point we had debated earlier.

Design:
* Added clarification about correspondence between associations in characteristics list and database entries.
* Changed KeyTriple class to private, because constructor should only be used in Component 1.
* Added indications of how errors would be handled, for consistency with the test plan.
* Changed the "query" to "userQuery" for consistency with Component 2. We changed the name of the method to avoid confusion with Component 3's database query.

Test Plan:
* Added more specific cases for testing correctness of the file to tree conversion method.
