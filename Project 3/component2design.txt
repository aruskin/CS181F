Component 2 Design

The purpose of this module is to: 
1) create a binary tree of the dichotomous key by reading in a text
representation of the key
2) provide a method for traversing the tree based on the user's
input and returning a list of the characteristics of the plant compiled based on
the user's selections

Need to import Java's Bailey structures library
http://dept.cs.williams.edu/JavaStructures//doc/structure5/index.html
to get BinaryTree, Node, Association, List

Need to import Java's io library for BufferedReader, FileReader, Scanner

Provides a structure for the data stored in each node of the binary
tree to allow easier access to each individual part (question, left answer, etc)

public class KeyTriple{
       * variables:
		* question (String): the question associated with this
		(for example, "Does the plant have broad or narrow
		leaves?")
		* left (Association<String, String>): the key will be
		the answer associated with the question and the value
		will be the name of the file with an image for that
		answer (for example <"broad" = ".../broad.gif">)
		* right (Association<String, String>): the key will be
		the answer associated with the question and the value
		will be the name of the file with an image for that
		answer (for example,, <"narrow" = ".../narrow.gif">)
	* methods: 
	  	// to create an instance of the class; parameters for
		all data needed for the variables
	  	 *public KeyTriple (String q, String lft, String
		 lftImg, String rt, String rtImg){}

	  	//need accessor methods for each value
	  	* public String getQuestion() {}
		* public String getLeftAnswer() {}
		* public String getRightAnswer() {}
		* public String getLeftFileName() {}
		* public String getRightFileName() {} 
		// Component 2 can take care of actually accessing the
		image files
}


METHODS: 

Helper method for converting file to binary tree; recursively creates
nodes based on lines from text file. BufferedReader is a class that
allows efficient reading of lines from a stream.

private BinaryTree<KeyTriple> readFileHelper(BufferedReader reader){
	*  variables:
		* line (String): stores the current line of the file
	* reader reads in a line from the file
	* text in file should be formatted in such a way that each
	line contains the question, answers, and names of image files,
	separated by specific tokens so that we can parse out the data
	from each line
	* if there's an indication that the line is not a leaf, return
	a tree with the value from the line and call this method again
	for each of the children
	* else if there's an indication that the line is a leaf,
	return a tree with the value from the line and no children
}

Actual method to convert file to binary tree, takes in name of file to
be converted, returns completed tree. 

public BinaryTree<KeyTriple> fileToTree(String filename){
       * create a BufferedReader whose input is a FileReader for the
       filename indicated
       * call readFileHelper on that BufferedReader
}

Method to traverse tree based on user input, takes in a binary tree
with dichotomous key data, returns list of characteristics indicated
by the user. 

public List<Association<String, String>> traverse(BinaryTree<KeyTriple> tree){
    * variables:
	* finger (Node): the node that we're currently considering
	* done (Boolean): whether or not we're finished traversing the
    	tree
	* characteristicsList(List<Association<String, String>>): the
    	list of characteristics of the plant which will be used by
    * Component 3 to search the database 
    	* set finger to the root of the tree
    * set done to false
    while(!done){ //user has not yet reached a leaf or elected to skip
	* send the value of the current node to Component 2, using the
	query method, which will return "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "SKIP"
	* variable result(String) stores the result of the call to query
	if(result == "SKIP") then set done to true
	else{
		* variable plantChar(Association<String, String>): the
    		key will be the question associated with current node, the value
    		will be the answer the user has chosen
		* push plantChar onto characteristicsList
		* update finger to appropriate child of node (as
    		indicated by result)
		if(finger.isEmpty) then set done to true
		//this means we have reached a leaf
	}
    }
    return characteristicsList
}
