Component 3—Database Search


General description & role in system:


This component takes in a list of associations of questions and answers that the user has specified from Component 1 and searches through the plant database to find the top ten matches.  It creates a list of plants that have the highest matching percentage, which is determined by how many of the associations match a plant.  Because some characteristics of the plants might not be obvious nor easy to identify for some users, we want to be able to return the highest matches from the database, even if none of them exactly match the list of associations.  This list is passed on to Component 4 where the user can look through the top ten results.


Interface:


The database search component takes in the list of associations of questions and answers from Component 1 and runs through the database question by question, as it filters out the plants that best match the given answer.  Since the database is organized as a table with the questions as column lables and the values as answers, all this component needs to do is to look up each question within the table and check which plants match the answer that is in the given list.  A list will be compiled that will contain the top matches that have a matching percentage of 50% or better, based on how many associations of that plant match the user's answers (i.e. a certain plant “P” in the table shows that it has 4 of the 6 given associations in the list; therefore it has a 67% match).  This list of top matching plants as well as their percentage match will be passed on to Component 4, which will properly display the returned results to the user. 


Requirements:


-Must read in list of associations in a specific format (List<Association<String,String>>) for easy iteration to look up in the database
-Must have a working database that can be searched through by association
-Database must be large enough to be able to return plants that match the given associations (using a dummy database for this project) as well as their percentage match
-Must have the ability to look up each association within the database and return a list of plants that have that feature
-Must be able to return a list of top ten results and their associated matching percentages
