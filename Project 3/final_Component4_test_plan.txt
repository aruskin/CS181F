 Component 4 Test Plan
 Siyao Xie

 Functionality Overview:
 Component 4 needs to display the search results returned by Component 3 by 
 relevancy (from the highest number of keyword matches to the lowest). For
 each plant in the list, a thumbnail image of the plant, its common name and 
 its percentage of match will be displayed. 

 The component also needs to handle mouse click selections and keyboard 
 inputs ("up" and "down" for scrolling). And when the user selects one plant 
 from the list, it needs to display the factsheet of the selected plant in a 
 new window. 
 
 General Approach:
 With the list of search results from Component 3 (assuming the search has 
 been triggered in Component 2 and searching has been done in Componeng 3), 
 an interactive window will correctly display the search results (correct 
 order, correct thumbnail, name, and percentage for each plant). Automated 
 GUI testing framework UISpec4J will be used to simulate user activities (]
 mouse click selections) on each item in the list. After selection, the 
 correct factsheet should be displayed in a new window with no missing or
 ill-formatted information.

 Testing framework:
 UISpec4J is an Open Source functional and/or unit testing library for Swing-
 based Java applications, built on top of JUnit and TestNG. UISpec4J's APIs 
 are designed to hide, as much as possible, the complexity of Swing, 
 resulting in easy-to-write and easy-to-read test scripts. It provides a
 library that allow us to easily simulates interaction of GUI.

List of Test Cases:


Results Page Display:

Results Layout Testing (Black box)
Assertion: 
	Items have homogenous layout across the list.

Justification:
	This is an important user interface requirement. The layout must be consistent across items to achieve visual balance.

Testing:
	With the list of search results from Component 3 (assuming the search has 
 	been triggered in Component 2 and searching has been done in Componeng 3, 
 	an interactive window will display the search results.

Correctness:
	Assert dimension value equal to design:
	Same height, same margin, thumbnail takes up the same amount of space, 
	spacing between thumbnail, plant name and percentage are the same. 



No Results Returned Test (Black box)
Assertion:
	If no result is returned by Component 3, the window should display "No 
	Results Found".

Justification:
	User might input invalid searches that yield no results or the database
	might not have the matching results. It is important to let them know
	that the search is unsucessful.

Testing:
	This test requires simulating Component 3 returning no result (results.size() = 0).

Correctness:
	Assert the error message displayed equal to intended error message. 


Unaccessible Thumbnail Test (White box)
Assertion:
	When a thumbnail is missing or unaccessible, a placeholder image drawn by Jframe 
	will be displayed instead.

Justification:
	Memory corruption or bad operations could result in file loss. The 
	thumbnail images stored on the local disk might be temporarily
	unaccessible, accidently deleted or renamed. To minimize the effect, 
	a placeholder image should be displayed instead.

Testing:
	Remove an arbitrary thumbnail from the local thumbnails folder or change 
	its name. Display a list of search results where the thumbnail is needed.

Correctness:
	Assert image displayed equal to placeholder image in size and color.


Results Page Interaction:

Scrolling Test (Black box)
Assertion:
	When pressing "up" or "down" on the keyboard, the list of results should 
	be able to scroll up and down.

Justification:
	The total length of the list of results might exceed the height of the display window, thus scrolling is needed.

Testing:
	UISpec4J will simulate keyboard input to scroll up and down multiple times:
	at the top of the list, at the bottom of the list and in the middle of the 
	list.

Correctness:
	Assert slider knob position equal to intended position.
	Scrolls up or down according to the action performed.


Display Factsheet Test (Black box)
Assertion:
	When clicking to select a plant in the results list, the factsheet display 
	window will display the corresponding plant's factsheet.

Justification:
	This is an important functional requirement.

Testing:
	UISpec4J will simulate clicking to open a new window to display the 
	factsheet. It will go down the list and select all of the items one by one 
	to ensure that all items are working. Each new selection triggers the 
	factsheet window to refresh and display the new corresponding factsheet.

Correctness:
	Assert the factsheet displayed equal to intended factsheet. 


Unaccessible Factsheet Test (White box)
Assertion:
	When clicking to select a plant in the results list, if the corresponding 
	factsheet is unavailable, the factsheet display window will display an 
	error message "Factsheet Unavailable".

Justification:
	Memory corruption or bad operations could result in file loss. The 
	factsheets stored on the local disk might be temporarily unaccessible, 
	accidently deleted or renamed. The user should be notified with a clear 
	message. No back button is necessary here since the results list page is 
	in another window.

Testing:
	To set up, some of the factsheets will be intentionally removed from the 
	local folder. When UISpec4J simulates clicking through the list of 
	results, some of the plants will not have a corresponding factsheet.

Correctness:
	Assert the error message displayed equal to intended error message.
