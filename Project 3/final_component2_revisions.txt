Final Component 2 Revisions
Last updated 12/2/2012

SPECS:
**Clarified that pictures ARE included in this component. Was already in the specs but
   was accidentally left out of the remaining portions. Went through and updated all
   documents to reflect this specification.
**Clarified that component 1 passes a node's VALUE, not the node itself.
**Changed "binary search tree" -> "search tree" since not really a BST. An incorrect
   vocabulary use.
**Removed requirement that it is "easy and clear to use". This was not quantifiable.
   Instead changed to consistancy of display within the window.

DESIGN:
**Added leftPicture and rightPicture as variables.
**Changed all variables except for nextNode to private, as they will only be
   accessed in this class.
**Changed portions with "NodeValue" to have "KeyTriple".
**removed main() method, as it is not handled in this class. It will be done in
   the overarching method that controls all four components.
**Added closeWindow method to be used by the overarching control method to clean up
   after window is done being used.
**Clarified reason for actionEvent vs. clicked methods within the comments.
**Renamed "query" method to "userQuery" to distinguish between it and the component
   3 class "Query".

TESTING:
**Changed incorrect input passed test from "exiting" to "error". This component does
   not handle exiting the whole program - it simply needs to detect an error and pass
   that information along.
**Changed from NodeValue to KeyTriple.
**Clarified and expanded the testing for the correct information display test based on
   the tests proposed for component 4.
