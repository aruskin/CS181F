SPECS:
-clarify that pictures ARE included in this component. was in specs but was accidentally left out of the remaining portions
-clarify that component 1 passes a node's VALUE, not the node itself
-"binary search tree" -> "search tree" since not really binary, as values aren't 
   really comparable...
-remove requirement that it is "easy and clear to use" - not quantifiable. changed 
   to consistancy for the readability.

DESIGN:
-Added leftPicture and rightPicture as variables
-Changed all variables except for nextNode to private, as they will only be
   accessed in this class
-Changed portions with "NodeValue" to have "KeyTriple".
-removed main() method, as it is not handled in this class - should be done in
   the overarching method that controls all four components.
-Added closeWindow method to be used by the overarching control method.
-Clarified reason for actionEvent vs. clicked methods.

TESTING:
-changed incorrect input passed from "exiting" to "error"
-changed from NodeValue to KeyTriple
-clarify and expand the testing for the correct information display test
