Component 1


Component 1 Spec Review
Summary: creates binary tree from the dichotomous key by reading in text representation 
of key; traverses tree based on users answers and returns list of characteristics of the plant the user is searching for
1. size of binary trees we will be dealing with
2. maintaining correct relationships with component 2 and 3
3. make sure we are using the same database
Component 1 Design Review
1. component 3 will be receiving a List<Association<String, String>>, where the first string represents the name of the category and the second string represents the user’s choice
2. how will component 3 interact with component 1 (how will the List<Association<String, String>> be passed)
3. will this component deal with clean up?
Component 1 Test Plan Review
1. what if your component returns an incomplete list (affects interaction with Component 3)?
