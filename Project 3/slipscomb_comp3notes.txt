COMPONENT 3

DESIGN
-In the Interface description is says it takes in the assocaitions from component 2, but it's actually from component 1.
-Looks like you've got the SQL methods down fine; your pseudocoding looks like it will turn into fine working code!
-Is ResultSet a class in SQL? It's not defined anywhere so it would be good to clarify that.
-This might be a good component to handle the main() method for the overall applet... we should talk about it.
-Nitpicky but: in makeList might want to change from l to a different variable name for it. I misread it as "1" and was really confused! 



TESTING
-Black box: probably need to be more specific about how we're checking the results against the correct answer. We're going to need to figure out by hand the percentages and list order, I think, to make sure the component is returning the right results.
-Complete association list: should a missing association maybe be an error rather than just skipped?
-How does component 1 handle a signal to ask for questions again if the association list is empty? Maybe instead of a signal we just restart the process? I don't think comp. 1 has a way to receive signals from comp. 3 at the moment.
-Not sure I understand how the valid and complete database test works. This would be a feasbile way to check the database if it's small, but a larger database makes this check really long and we may miss some parts. Would like clarification about this test (how it will be written) and what the intent is.

The design seems really clear and should be feasible to take from pseudocode to working code. For the testing, would like to see how the tests will actually be verified - a lot are tests that should return the "correct" result, but doesn't show how we obtain a correct result to start with to check against.
