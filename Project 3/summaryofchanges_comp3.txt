Summary of fixes for Component 3:


1. Specs: 
1. Fix vocabulary (“list of associations” should be “list of associations of questions and the user’s answers”)
2. Instead of displaying the top 10 matches, display the top matches that have a percentage match of 50% or higher
3. Instead of returning a list of top plants, return a list of top plants and their percentage match
4. Added comments of error handling
1. Design: 
1. Fix vocabulary (“list of associations” should be “list of associations of questions and the user’s answers”)
2. Changed the condition for while loop from not null to not empty 
3. Renamed list “l” to “L” for easier clarification
4. Moved database information outside of main for organization 
5. Clarifying how this component filters out results (one possibility for future version: given list of associations, query the database for all n associations, if it returns nothing then query the database for n-1 associations, name methods) 
6. Fixed parameter of queryPlant from List<Association<String, String>> to Association<String, String> 
7. Fixed return type of makeList (from List<String> to List<Association<String,String>>)
8. This component should return the percentage match with the given plant: List<Association<String, String>>
9. Added comments of error handling
1. Test: 
1. Clarify the pre-made lists for black box testing (to test for correctness)
2. Restart the entire process if returned a null list (as opposed to just signaling Component 1)
