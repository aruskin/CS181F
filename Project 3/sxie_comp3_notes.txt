Component 3 Review Notes

Spec:
- returning the top 10 results? What if there aren't enough results? What if most of them only match with one of the attributes? What if there are draws, how should we decide which goes into the top 10?
- clarification: is the database part of component 2 or it is assumed to be ready outside of component 2?

Design:
Good commenting and formatting. Easy to read and understand.

- What format of associations Component 3 is expecting exactly? Component 1 is returning a list of associations where the key will be the question associated with current node, the value will be the answer the user has chosen. How is component 3 going to parse the question string to obtain the keywords? 

- Only having the instance initilization and final return is a bit confusing because of the missing steps. Maybe instead of writing them out like actual code, just comment about what it should return and the internal process.

Test Plan:
- Test 1: Should there be some way to compare the returned matches with the standard/actual matches instead of relying on a specific plant or the difference in percentage match by chaging one attribute?

- Should probably update the spec and design for the error handling cases (common problem for all of us :p).
