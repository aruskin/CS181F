Component 4 Tests
Siyao Xie

Functionality Overview:
Component 4 needs to display the search results returned by Component 3 by 
relevancy (from the highest number of keyword matches to the lowest). For
each plant in the list, a thumbnail image of the plant, its common name and 
its percentage of match will be displayed. 

The component also needs to handle mouse click selections and keyboard 
inputs ("up" and "down" for scrolling). And when the user selects one plant 
from the list, it needs to display the factsheet of the selected plant in a 
new window. 

General Approach:
Two tests suite will be run, each with a different simulated list of search results.
While the first test suite only tests for the case of an empty list of results,
the second test suite tests for the rest of test cases.

Test Case Index:

Test Suite 1:
 	No Results Returned Test

Test Suite 2:
	Display Results Test
	Unaccessible Thumbnail Test
	Scrolling Test 
	Display Factsheet Test
	Unaccessible Factsheet Test


List of Test Cases:

Test Suite 1:
No Results Returned Test
Assertion:
	If no result is returned by Component 3, the window should display "No 
	results found".

Justification:
	User might input invalid searches that yield no results or the database
	might not have the matching results. It is important to let them know
	that the search is unsucessful.

Testing:
	This test requires simulating Component 3 returning no result (results.size() = 0).

Correctness:
	Assert the error message displayed is the intended error message. 


Test Suite 2:

Display Results Test
Assertion: 
	Results with a matching percentage over or equal to 50% (in this case, 11 items out of 15 returned)
  	should be displayed in the order from the most relevant to the least relevant.

Justification:
	This is an important functional requirement.

Testing:
	With a simulated list of search results from Component 3, 
	an interactive window will display the search results.

Correctness:
	Assert only results with over or equal to 50% relevancy is displayed. Assert the results
	are displayed in the order of relevancy (most relevant to least relevant).



Unaccessible Thumbnail Test
Assertion:
	When a thumbnail is missing or unaccessible, a default image
	will be displayed instead.

Justification:
	Memory corruption or bad operations could result in file loss. The 
	thumbnail images stored on the local disk might be temporarily
	unaccessible, accidently deleted or renamed. To minimize the effect, 
	a placeholder image should be displayed instead.

Testing:
	Display a list of search results where some of the thumbnails needed is
	missing from the source folder.

Correctness:
	Assert default image is displayed when no thumbnail is available.



Scrolling Test
Assertion:
	When pressing "up" or "down" on the keyboard, or scrolling using mouse or touchpad, 
	the list of results should be able to scroll up and down.

Justification:
	The total length of the list of results might exceed the height of the display window, 
	thus scrolling is needed.

Testing:
	On the display window of search results, press up arrow and down arrow on the keyboard,
	scroll up and up with mouse and touchpad.

Correctness:
	Assert the content displayed is being scrolled up or down according to the operations
	performed.


Display Factsheet Test
Assertion:
	When clicking to select a plant in the results list, the factsheet display 
	window will display the corresponding plant's factsheet.

Justification:
	This is an important functional requirement.

Testing:
	Click on a plant (that has an available factsheet).

Correctness:
	Assert the factsheet displayed in the new window is the corresponding factsheet.


Unaccessible Factsheet Test
Assertion:
	When clicking to select a plant in the results list, if the corresponding 
	factsheet is unavailable, the factsheet display window will display an 
	error message "Factsheet Unavailable".

Justification:
	Memory corruption or bad operations could result in file loss. The 
	factsheets stored on the local disk might be temporarily unaccessible, 
	accidently deleted or renamed. The user should be notified with a clear 
	message. No back button is necessary here since the results list page is 
	in another window.

Testing:
	Click on a plant (that has no factsheet stored in the source folder).

Correctness:
	Assert the new window will display the correct error message "Factsheet Unavailable."



Testing Instructions:

Testing instructions and passing criterias are specified in the main function of ResultsPage.java as following:

 public static void main(String[] args) {
  /*
  Test Setup 1:
  Simulates empty list of results returned by component 3
  Passing criterias:
  An error message saying "No results found." should be displayed (along with a picture of a sad bunny)

  ***Insturction: uncomment the next line and comment line 235 to run Test 1
  */
  //emptyResultsTest();

  /*
  Test Setup 2:
  Simulates a list of results returned by component 3, including one plant that has actual thumbnail
  and factsheet files available in the local source folder and 14 other fake(test) plants that has
  no thumbnail or factsheet.
  
  Passing criterias:
  - Results with a matching percentage over or equal to 50% (in this case, 11 items out of 15 returned)
  should be displayed in the order from the most relevant to the least relevant.
  - The first item in the list should be Avocado, and a thumbnail image of avocado should be displayed.
  - The other 10 items in the list should have fake names (plant1 to plant10), the thumbnails displayed
  should be an default image (green square).
  - Should be able to scroll up and down using keyboard command "UP" and "DOWN" or scroll with mouse or
  touchpad.
  - After clicking on the first plant Avocado, a new window displaying the factsheet of avocado should
  pop up.
  - When clicking on any of the other 14 plants, a new window displaying an error message saying 
  "Factsheet Unavailable." should pop up.

  ***Insturction: uncomment the next line and comment line 212 to run Test 2
  */
  //displayResultsTest();
 }

Test Output:

All tests are passed.

Test 1:
-An error message saying "No results found." is displayed when no results are returned.

Test 2:
- Only results with a matching percentage over or equal to 50% (in this case, 11 items out of 15 returned)
are displayed in the order from the most relevant to the least relevant.
- The first item in the list is Avocado, and a thumbnail image of avocado is displayed.
- The other 10 items in the list have fake names (plant1 to plant10), the thumbnails displayed
are the default image (green square).
- Able to scroll up and down using keyboard command "UP" and "DOWN", scrolling with mouse and
touchpad.
- After clicking on the first plant Avocado, a new window displaying the factsheet of avocado
pops up.
- When clicking on any of the other 14 plants, a new window displaying an error message saying 
"Factsheet Unavailable." pops up.
