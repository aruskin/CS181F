Test Driven Development Report:

	The component has two main methods, traverse and fileToTree, which, for 
the purposes of testing, are independent of each other. However, in actual 
implementation, the tree that is passed to traverse should be constructed by 
fileToTree. By that logic, I decided to implement fileToTree first, but the order of 
implementation shouldn't have made a difference. Both methods depended on the 
implementation of the KeyTriple class, so I created a basic outline of the class before 
implementing fileToTree (which only uses on the class's constructor method) and 
then filled in the accessor methods before implementing traverse. While writing the 
traverse method, I realized that I needed to create a stand-in for Component 2, 
which I had not accounted for in my design. In retrospect, I probably should have 
considered those class dependencies more and completely implemented KeyTriple 
and FakeComponent2 before writing TreeTraversal's methods.
	Any inefficiency in the process was probably caused by the fact that I had 
completely forgotten how to program in Java. Otherwise, all of the test cases were 
remained relevant throughout the whole process, so building test cases was not a 
waste of time.
	Knowing that I was going to test the code certainly made me more aware of 
the methods' error handling cases, which I might have ignored otherwise. I also paid 
more careful attention to the format of the output from the methods.
