I have no idea how to do makefiles, so...

How to build from source (assuming you have Eclipse):
1) Download TreeTraversal_workspace from git
2) Open Eclipse with TreeTraversal_workspace as the workspace
3) Import->Existing Projects into Workspace-> choose TreeTraversal
4) Go to Preferences. Under Java, select Build Path->Classpath Variables->New.
Under Name, put "BAILEY" and for Path, choose "bailey.jar" from the workspace
