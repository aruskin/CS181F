Test Driven Development Plan:

1) Implement fileToTree method
	   -dependencies: need KeyTriple class to exist but not necessarily have any methods
	   -relevant tests:
	   	     1. Converting (correctly formatted) text input to binary tree
		     		  -need test files in correct format
		     2. Handling incorrectly formatted text input
		     		 -need test files in incorrect format (could be anything...)
		     8. Non-existent file passed in as a parameter to fileToTree method

2) Implement accessor methods for KeyTriple
   	     -dependencies: none
	     -relevant tests:
	     	       7. Accessor methods for KeyTriple work correctly

3) Implement traverse method
   	     -dependencies:
			- KeyTriple has working accessor methods
			- need simulation of Component 2's userQuery method
	     -relevant tests:
	     	       3. Traversing the tree (stopping at leaves)
		       4. Traversing the tree (skipping)
		       5. Handling unexpected input from Component 2
		       6. Passing correct information to Component 2
		       	  - need Component 2 to save list of values passed from traverse and return them
			    at the end
		       9. Empty tree passed in as a parameter to traverse method
