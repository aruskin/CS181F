COMPONENT 2 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

Once all files are in the correct location, testing can simply be run by executing the main()
function within the Testing class. If any of the tests fail, an exception will be thrown, stopping
the testing suite. As each test passes, it prints a line of notification to the user within the console.

If all tests pass, the message "All tests passed!" appears in the console.
