main method:

The main function currently contains tests for the component,
which are supposed to be in a separate automated test suite.
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST FIX

The main function still contains some commented out code.
Characterization: ISSUE
SHOULD FIX


getSize method:

After some discussion, we decided that this method was unnecessary,
since the errors it handled could be better dealt with elsewhere,
and it would be inefficient in the cases where the input is actually
valid.
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST FIX

getResultSet method:

The current method uses specific entries in the database and would not
work if the database fields were to change.
Characterization: ISSUE
MUST FIX

We discussed the potential use of macros for nested classes (such as
Queue<Association<String, String>>) to make code shorter and easier
to read.
Characterization: QUESTION
COMMENT

sort method:

We were unsure whether the current method would be the most efficient sort
method. Although we're not overly concerned with complexity, may want to 
look into alternate methods.
Characterization: QUESTION
COMMENT

Overall:

Variable names are not descriptive, which makes the code difficult to read.
Characterization: QUESTION
SHOULD FIX

There aren't any comments within the methods, which makes it hard to understand
what the code is supposed to be doing.
Characterization: QUESTION
SHOULD FIX

Conclusion: Code approved with required changes.
