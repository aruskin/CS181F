Code Review: Component 3
Reviewer: Siyao Xie

Main:
- It might be better to put these tests into an actual test class with each test as a
separate method of the test class (test suite).

- Also there are many commented out code. What are they for? Should probably remove from
the final version.

getSize:
- Is there a build in size function for queue?
- Shouldn't the list passed from Component 1 contain no association that has empty strings? 
Is this trying to deal with the case when users skip? Then shouldn't only
the last association's value be empty? So maybe you can just check to see if the
last association is valid then return list.size() or list.size()-1?

getResults:
- Not quite understanding line 125-135. This part of the code seems very specific to only 
the broadest (first) question. What about the other questions and queries?

- Need more commenting to explain what line 138-147 is doing..... Especially for this
if statement: if (temp2.getValue().equals(rs.getString(temp2.getKey()))), it might be
better to declares some of the variables above.

- Is there only one entry in rs ever?

- Readibility will benefit a lot from more descriptive variable names. 
(a? rs? temp? temp2? j? count??)

sort:
- It does not seem like the most efficient sorting ever.... but it seems to work.
- z and y as variable names are kind of twisting my brain. 

Overall:
The code makes sense to me for the most part. But it seems to only work for some specific
test cases (the ones given).

Comments: 
There only exists the most high level comments, thus making the code very hard to understand.
It is hard to see if the code is obviously correct or not with more detailed comments.

Variable names:
Having better variable names can increase the readability of the code a lot too. These vague
and abstract names might also make it hard to code and debug in the process.
