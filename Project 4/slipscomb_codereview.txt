Code Review: Component 3

**COMMENTING
There is NO commenting within the functions! These are really long functions and they could use
quite a bit of commenting - especially since using databases is new to all of us and it would be
good for clarifying what's happening.

**TESTS
The tests shouldn't be in the main() function, the should be in a separate testing function. I think
that JUnit is what is usually used? That way you provide asserts that the return values are correct,
not just judging it by eye. At the moment the tests aren't automated because they require human
input to judge the answers.

**FUNCTION LENGTH
These seem like REALLY long functions - is there any way you can break them down into helper
functions? I'm worried that during debugging, if you run into errors, it will be hard to track down
which part of the code led to the actual issue.

**getResultSet CONDITIONALS
I don't understand why there are "magic values" coded in here on lines 125 - 135. This makes it
look to me like the code is written specifically for one database (which it shouldn't be). These values
(such as "TREEORBUSH") should be variables from the parameters of the function, shouldn't they?
Or at least variables passed from the database, not typed in by you?

**LONG TYPE NAMES
List<Association<String, Integer>> is really long! Do you know if there's a
way to make a macro or something to be able to cut the length of this down
a bit? It would greatly simplify the code, and would make it easier to read
both while coding and reviewing.

**LOOP VARIABLES
Using names like i,m,z,etc. makes it hard to tell what each for loop is doing
in the code. Maybe more explicit variable names would be useful for future
reference.

**DOCUMENT STRINGS
In addition to commenting within the functions, I think docstrings would be
a good thing to add. I think the function names are fairly clear but it would
make it much more clear what each is doing.
